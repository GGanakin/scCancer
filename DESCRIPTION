Description: The package 'scCancer' is focuses on processing and analyzing 
    scRNA-seq data for cancer research. Except routine data processing steps, 
    it also integrates several cancer-specific analyses. For example, 
    more comprehensive quality control, cancer microenvironment cell types 
    prediction, cell malignancy estimation, gene set signature scores calculation,
    and expression programs identification. After all steps, the package can
    generate a user-friendly graphic report.
